Analysis of tweets from the Cyber Summit 2012
------------
This repository contains the scripts and functions being used to analyze twitter data from
the [Cyber Summit 2012](http://www.cybera.ca/summit2012) in Banff. Briefly, the script 
searches twitter for the hashtag #cybersummit, downloads posts containing this hashtag and 
then generates the following plots of the data:
- Barplot of top n twitteratis, where n=20 by default
- Time series of the number of tweets per hour
- Bar chart of most commonly used hash tags
- Word clouds of tweets

These figures are used in the following blog posts **pending**.
